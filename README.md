# fract_ol

## Description
- Program where you can visually explore different fractals and produce pretty images.
- This was made as a school project for [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/).
- Runs on the CPU and is coded from scratch because of project restrictions set by the school.


## Requirements
- SDL2 library. Install on macos by running ```brew install sdl2```
## Build
1. Run ```make``` in the project directory to build the project.
2. Run the created binary file.

## Usage
Controls on US keyboard:
- Change fractals with ```1```, ```2``` and ```3``` keys.
- Move by clicking and dragging with mouse and zoom using ```[``` and ```]```
- Iterations can be increased and decresed with ```-``` and ```=```
- Colors can be changed with ```,``` and ```.```
- Julia set position can be changed by changing mouse mode with ```M```
- Change between single threaded and multithreaded mode with ```T``` (some colors work better in single thread).
